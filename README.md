# FilmQueryProject
## Description
### This project presents a user with a console interface through which they can query the database of a notional video store to obtain information on the films contained in the store's inventory. Users can query either by a search term or film id (a unique id assigned to each film in the store's inventory, like the PLU of produce items in a grocery store). Querying by search term looks for the search term in a film's title or description. If the user's search is successful, they will be presented with basic information on each of the films returned. The user can then choose whether to return to the main menu or view the full details of the films returned by their search.
## Technologies Used
### The video store's database was stored in a local mySQL database and was accessed using MAMP. The user interface and database connection was coded using Java, and Maven was used to manage dependencies.
## Lessons Learned
### It is best to start simple and move out. Several times I thought of the phrase "minimum viable product". Guided by this mantra, I managed to reach not only all of the given user stories, but all of the stretch goals as well.
### I also loved having (and making and taking) the opportunity to dive a little deeper into creating and running JUnit tests.
